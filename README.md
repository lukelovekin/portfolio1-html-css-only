Tablet screens are the same layout and design as the mobile screen wireframes but with extra padding on the sides of the screen.

## Planning, Styling and Development

With absolutely no sense of style or knowing what looks good I started by look at other peoples websites and figuring out what I liked.

After trying to find inspiration I decided to set up my portfolio in a grid like style having all page titles, with their links, appear in large, each having their own seperate square making it easy for audience engagement.
After further stuggles on how to design I drew up some wireframes which included a basic design on how I would like my page to look and where I would put all my portfolios components and how I wanted my grid laid out and how they would look with content in them. After deciding on the assignment's minimum viable product and where I want them in my grid I then started on the html structure which included the following pages:
- index.html (main page)
- contact.html (contact page with a contact form)
- about.html (about page including content about myself)
- news.html (blog page with links to blogs I have created)
- resume.html (resume page with a pdf viewer withoptions to download and print resume)
- tech.html (A technical portfolio page with links to my current and past tech projects)

After creating some content and notes into each html page I first started with the home page just to make a start as quick as I could using css/ grids and flexbox layout, I got my base model idea on how the rest of the portfolio will look.
During the whole build process I was constantly pushing to my source control repository and testing and fixing which is where most of my time went.

After looking for color schemes that I thought I liked, such as reds, oranges and yellows, trialing them and realising they didn't look great, I decided to play it safe and play around with some whites, light greys. I found a photo on unsplash.com I thought I would try out and it had looked better than anything else I had tried dor far, so I decided to leave it on for the time being and ended up keeping it.
After setting up the homepage the way I liked it I started in the linking pages basing them on the same concept as the home page, header at the top, sidebar on the left and a square for content in the middle.
To help with audience engagement I decided to make the screen less cluttered and remove the sidebar on smaller screens and replace it with a toggle button in the header.

Upon reflection I started my development process without too much thought in that I just wanted to get layout up and running with assignment content and then when that is all done I would further style and add special effects. In hindsight, I didn't plan enough and didn't consider time or what effects I would put where and ended up runnig out of time to do most effects I Had planned on having to settle with some issues I was having with ideal positioning. I'm still not at all confident in my design and styling abilities although I have a better idea of what dosen't look good, and what not to do next time.
